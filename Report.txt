How Much Coding Is Needed?
Not a lot — focus on gluing libraries together rather than writing everything from scratch. You'll code:

~50–100 lines for voice input/output (mic → text → speech).
~50 lines for AI brain (prompts, personalities, memory).
~100 lines for visuals (Pygame window, animations).
~50 lines for main loop (listening, switching modes, etc.).
Total: Manageable, like building a small React app with state and events.

You won't code the heavy stuff — libraries handle STT/TTS/AI/model running. It's like using npm packages in JS.
