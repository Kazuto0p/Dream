How Much Coding Is Needed?
Not a lot — focus on gluing libraries together rather than writing everything from scratch. You'll code:

~50–100 lines for voice input/output (mic → text → speech).
~50 lines for AI brain (prompts, personalities, memory).
~100 lines for visuals (Pygame window, animations).
~50 lines for main loop (listening, switching modes, etc.).
Total: Manageable, like building a small React app with state and events.

You won't code the heavy stuff — libraries handle STT/TTS/AI/model running. It's like using npm packages in JS.



Step-by-Step: How to Start
Start small: Get Python running on your Pi, then build voice-first (no avatar yet) to feel progress fast. Use a code editor like VS Code (remote SSH to Pi) or Thonny (Pi's built-in). I'll give exact commands and starter code.
1. Setup Your Raspberry Pi (1 Hour, No Coding)

Install OS: If not done, flash Raspberry Pi OS (Lite or Desktop) via Raspberry Pi Imager. Boot up, connect to WiFi.


Update & Install Python: Python 3 is pre-installed, but update:

code :
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
  sudo apt install python3-pip git

Install Ollama for Local AI: (For your offline brain)

code :
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
  ollama pull phi3:mini  # Small, fast model ~2GB download. Use 'gemma2:2b' if you want more playful.
  ollama run phi3:mini   # Test it: Type a message, see response.

Install Voice Libs
code :
  sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev portaudio19-dev alsa-utils  # For audio
  pip install vosk speechrecognition pyaudio pyttsx3  # STT/TTS basics (we'll upgrade to Piper later)
Test mic: arecord -l (lists devices). Speakers: aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav.

Project Folder
code :
  mkdir ai_waifu
  cd ai_waifu
  touch main.py personalities.py memory.json



2. Learn Basic Python (If Needed, 2–3 Hours)

Free: Codecademy Python course (first few lessons) or freeCodeCamp YouTube (1-hour intro).
Key Similarities to JS: Variables (name = "Airi" like const name = "Airi"), functions (def greet(): like function greet()), objects (dict like JSON), loops/conditionals same.
Differences: Indent with spaces (no {}), print("hi") instead of console.log, import instead of import (ES modules).

3. Build Voice AI First (Day 1–2, ~100 Lines Code)
Start with a simple loop: Listen → AI respond → Speak.
In personalities.py:


Python code :
  PERSONALITIES = {
      "assistant": {
          "name": "Airi",
          "prompt": "You are a smart, polite desktop anime assistant. Be helpful and professional."
      },
      "waifu": {
          "name": "Airi",
          "prompt": "You are a caring, flirty anime girlfriend. Be emotional and playful."
      }
  }

In memory.json (initial):

JSON code :
  {
    "user_name": "Mahesh",
    "likes": ["coding", "anime"],
    "mood": "happy"
  }

In main.py (starter — copy-paste and run python main.py):
Python code :
  import json
  import speech_recognition as sr
  import pyttsx3
  from ollama import Client  # pip install ollama
  from personalities import PERSONALITIES
  
  # Load memory
  with open('memory.json', 'r') as f:
      memory = json.load(f)
  
  # Defaults
  current_mode = "assistant"
  client = Client()  # Ollama client
  engine = pyttsx3.init()  # TTS
  recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
  mic = sr.Microphone()
  
  def get_ai_response(user_text):
      personality = PERSONALITIES[current_mode]
      system_prompt = f"""
      You are {personality['name']}, an anime girl.
      Behavior: {personality['prompt']}
      User info: Name {memory['user_name']}, likes {', '.join(memory['likes'])}.
      Reply naturally.
      """
      
      response = client.chat(model='phi3:mini', messages=[
          {'role': 'system', 'content': system_prompt},
          {'role': 'user', 'content': user_text}
      ])
      return response['message']['content']
  
  def speak(text):
      engine.say(text)
      engine.runAndWait()
  
  print("Listening... Say something!")
  while True:
      with mic as source:
          audio = recognizer.listen(source)
      try:
          user_text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)  # Or use Vosk for offline
          if "switch to waifu" in user_text.lower():
              current_mode = "waifu"
              speak("Switching to waifu mode! 💕")
          elif "switch to assistant" in user_text.lower():
              current_mode = "assistant"
              speak("Back to assistant mode.")
          else:
              response = get_ai_response(user_text)
              print("AI:", response)
              speak(response)
      except:
          pass  # Ignore errors


Test: Run it, speak "Hello", hear response. Add offline STT: Replace recognize_google with Vosk (pip install vosk, download model from vosk site).
Upgrade TTS: Later, pip install piper-tts, swap pyttsx3 for better voices.

4. Add Avatar (Day 3–4, ~100 Lines)
Install Pygame: pip install pygame.
Add to main.py: Create a window, load PNGs (download free anime sprites online), animate when speaking.
Example snippet:


Python code :

  import pygame
  
  pygame.init()
  screen = pygame.display.set_mode((300, 400))
  idle_img = pygame.image.load('assets/idle.png')
  
  # In speak function:
  # While engine speaking, blit talking frames to screen

5. Polish (Day 5+)

Add memory updates: In code, if user says "Remember I like X", update JSON.
Boot on startup: Add to Pi's crontab.
Better voices: Download Piper anime-style models.
